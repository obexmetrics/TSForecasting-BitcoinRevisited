# TSForecasting-obexmetrics

Extraction of [TSForecasting](https://github.com/rakshitha123/TSForecasting) for reproducing results for bitcoin predictions.

## Getting Started

Run `start.sh` to build and run our Docker container that executes the analysis.  

Output defaults to our local `TSForecasting/results` directories.

## TODO

- Use local volume mount for input data files hardcoded at `TSForecasting/tsf_data`
